description: Template for implementing new features using parallel agent swarms
patterns:
  - implement {{description}}
  - add {{description}} feature
  - create {{description}}
  - build {{description}}
  - new {{description}}
strategy: parallel
defaultAgents: 5
phases:
  - name: analysis
    description: Analyze codebase and understand requirements
    agentCount: 1
    taskTemplate: >
      Analyze the current codebase to understand the structure and existing patterns.
      Focus on: {{target}}. Identify where the new feature should be integrated,
      what dependencies exist, and what patterns to follow. Provide a detailed
      implementation plan with file locations and code structure recommendations.

  - name: design
    description: Design the feature architecture
    agentCount: 1
    taskTemplate: >
      Based on the analysis, design the architecture for: {{description}}.
      Define interfaces, data structures, and component relationships.
      Consider error handling, edge cases, and testing strategy.

  - name: implementation
    description: Implement the feature across the codebase
    agentCount: 3
    taskTemplate: >
      Implement {{description}} following the design specifications.
      Write clean, well-documented code with proper error handling.
      Follow existing code patterns and conventions in the codebase.
      Ensure type safety and proper TypeScript usage.

  - name: testing
    description: Add comprehensive tests
    agentCount: 2
    taskTemplate: >
      Write comprehensive tests for {{description}}.
      Include unit tests, integration tests, and edge case coverage.
      Ensure all tests pass and code coverage is acceptable.

  - name: verification
    description: Verify implementation and run final checks
    agentCount: 1
    taskTemplate: >
      Verify the complete implementation of {{description}}.
      Run the full test suite, check for type errors, lint issues,
      and ensure the feature works as expected. Review code quality
      and adherence to project standards.
